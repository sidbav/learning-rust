# Learning Rust

Using this repo to store any of the initial rust learnings that I have

- intro - Following along this YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF34dRivLOw) to learn the basics of rust

## TODO
- understand difference between `str` and `String` in rust
- classes
- std lib in rust
- why no varags in rust (and understanding how macro works, for example, `println!` or `vec!`)
